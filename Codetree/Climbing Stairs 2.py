# Now this one was tricky.
# The constraint was that you can take either 1 step or 2 steps to the top,
# but you can only take up to 3 steps if you take 1 step.

# My idea was valid, but the implementation was wrong.
# What I thought was:
# 1. dp[i][j] means you consider the i-th step with j steps(for single step taken).
# 2. So it needs to be evaluated by the previous state, which is dp[i-1][j-1] + coins[i] or dp[i-2][j] + coins[i].
# 3. You can access every step by taking 1 step, so the dp table should be initialized by 0.
# It worked for simple cases, but didn't last for longðŸ˜“.

# So, the takeaways are:
# 1. Make sure to set the starting point correctly.
# 2. Make concrete definitions for each state.
# 3. Think of unreachable states and how to handle them.
