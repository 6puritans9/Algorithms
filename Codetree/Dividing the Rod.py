# This one is a minor tweak of previous knapsack problem.
# While the previous one didn't allow the use of same element multiple times,
# this one allows the same element to be used multiple times.
# Which is more straightforward to implement by iterating from 1 to n.
# Only took less than 10 minutes to solve this problem! Love it!ðŸ¥°
